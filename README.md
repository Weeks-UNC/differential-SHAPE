Differential SHAPE
================================================================================
The differential SHAPE experiment uses three reagents, the workhorse 1M7
(1-methyl-7-nitroisatoic anhydride) reagent to measure local nucleotide dynamics,
plus NMIA and 1M6 (N-methylisatoic anhydride and 1-methyl-6-nitroisatoic
anhydride) which together detect higher-order and noncanonical interactions.
Among other uses, the resulting three-reagent SHAPE experiment makes possible
very accurate modeling of RNA secondary structure.
